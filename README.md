# AI ChatBot with Ethical AI principles

### Objective: 
- Developed a Conversational AI Chatbot (QnA Bot) using Microsoft Azure Language Service to enhance the navigation experience on St. Clair College's website.

### Problem Addressed: 
- The college website faced high traffic from students seeking information on courses and services, which was often challenging to navigate due to the vast amount of unstructured information.

### Solution:
- Created a chatbot to assist students in finding details on various programs and corresponding campus information.
- Implemented a context tree structure with follow-up prompts to organize and streamline responses, making information retrieval more intuitive.
- We utilized a small, sample dataset containing selected courses and additional information (e.g., campus details, 360-degree view options), with potential for expansion through additional Q&A sets.

### Improvement Areas:
- Recognized the need for faculty support to better understand the flow and prioritization of college-related information.
- Observed that a structured hierarchy (context tree) simplifies information processing for the chatbot, enabling more effective Q&A handling.

### Impact: 
- Aimed to enhance the user experience on the college website by simplifying the process of finding course and campus-related information, reducing confusion, and improving navigation for prospective and current students.

This project illustrates how advanced conversational AI can improve user experience on content-heavy websites through structured, targeted information delivery
